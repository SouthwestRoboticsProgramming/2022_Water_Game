Communication between driver station & robot:

Deploying code requires physical USB connection (discourages people from hogging the test area)
When in test mode robot hosts WiFi network for DS to join; control can be over serial or WiFi
When in game mode robot and DS connect to field WiFi and WMS bridges the connections; can still control when tethered

Most convenient event structure would be:
1. Give teams time to build and program robot initially
2. Let people test and tune robots
3. Reflash WiFi modules with game mode firmware
4. Run matches, teams can still modify code and test over USB
